	\framesubtitle{Some Questions and Issues}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How many people ever get to see an HPC?
		\item Hardware less abstract
		\item Real system are busy doing actual research (85 - 95\% load on systems)
		\item Fear amongst learners that they are going to break the multi-million Â£ system they are playing on
		\item Resource limits more apparent
		\item More control over the environment
		\item No need to have accounts on a real HPC
		\item No need for expensive cloud hosting
		\item Own access point, so independent of university networks or the Internet
